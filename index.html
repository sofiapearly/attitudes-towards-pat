    <h1>Attitudes Toward Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Among Qualified Psychological Therapists and Trainee Psychological Therapists in Scotland: Information Sheet</h1>
    <h2>Glasgow Caledonian University</h2>

    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The aim of the study is to compare attitudes toward psychedelic-assisted therapy among trainee and qualified psychological therapists in Scotland. The study further investigates whether professional status (trainee vs. psychological therapists) and exposure to a short vignette about psychedelic-assisted therapy influences attitudes towards this therapy. The study is being conducted by Sofia Pearly Dahlstrom, supervised by Dr. James Munro at Glasgow Caledonian University, as a part of an educational course for the award of Doctorate in Counselling Psychology.</p>
        <p>Before you decide whether or not to take part, it is important for you to understand what participation in the study will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Please contact us at the address below if you would like more information.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="importance">
        <h2>Why is this study important?</h2>
        <p>This is an important study because there is limited knowledge about how trainees and qualified psychological therapists in Scotland perceive psychedelic-assisted therapy. Understanding professional attitudes can inform training, education, and policy discussions, particularly as research and clinical trials for psychedelic-assisted therapy expand in the UK.</p>

    <section id="procedure">
        <h2>What will I have to do if I take part?</h2>
        <p>If you are interested in taking part, you will be invited to give consent. Giving consent will involve a mandatory tick-box on the next page in this online survey. No signed consent form is required because participation is anonymous.</p>
        <p>If you decide to participate, you can proceed with completing this online survey. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. At the start, you will be asked to create a memorable phrase, consisting of two random words and two digits. This phrase must not include or be linked in any way to your personally identifiable information. Any formulas for creating memorable phrases that combine letters or digits from your names, telephone numbers, dates of birth, or similar identifiers must not be used. Please memorise this phrase, as it allows you to request withdrawal of your data by providing it to the researcher within two weeks of completing the survey.</p>
        <p>You will receive a brief, neutral description of psychedelic-assisted therapy and be randomly assigned to one of two conditions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A vignette describing psychedelic-assisted therapy</li>
            <li>A vignette describing supportive group therapy</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You will then be asked to complete the adapted Attitudes Toward Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy questionnaire.</p>
        <p>At the end of the survey, you will be asked to complete a brief demographic questionnaire (including: age range, gender, professional status, stage of training, years of professional experience, location of training/practice), and an open-ended question regarding your knowledge or experience of psychedelic-assisted therapy prior to this study.</p>
        <p>Participation is entirely online and can be completed at a time that is convenient for you. It is expected to take approximately 15 minutes to complete.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="voluntary">
        <h2>Do I have to take part?</h2>
        <p>No. You decide whether or not you want to take part. You can stop taking part in the study at any time, without giving a reason, by closing the survey before submitting your responses. If you do this, any partially completed responses will not be saved and will not be included in the study.</p>
        <p>Participation is voluntary, anonymous, and you may withdraw at any time by closing the survey. You may also skip any questions you do not wish to answer. You may also withdraw your data within two weeks of completing the survey by emailing the researcher with the memorable phrase that you created. Choosing not to participate or withdrawing from the study will not affect your professional status, training, or legal rights.</p>
