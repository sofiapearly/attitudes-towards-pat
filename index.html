    <h1>Attitudes Toward Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Among Qualified Psychological Therapists and Trainee Psychological Therapists in Scotland: Information Sheet</h1>
    <h2>Glasgow Caledonian University</h2>

    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The aim of the study is to compare attitudes toward psychedelic-assisted therapy among trainee and qualified psychological therapists in Scotland. The study further investigates whether professional status (trainee vs. psychological therapists) and exposure to a short vignette about psychedelic-assisted therapy influences attitudes towards this therapy. The study is being conducted by Dr. James Munro at Glasgow Caledonian University. The study is being carried out by Sofia Pearly Dahlstrom as a part of an educational course for the award of Doctorate in Counselling Psychology.</p>
        <p>Before you decide whether or not to take part, it is important for you to understand what participation in the study will involve.

    </section>

    <section id="importance">
        <h2>Why is this study important?</h2>
        <p>This is an important study because there is limited knowledge about how trainees and qualified psychological therapists in Scotland perceive psychedelic-assisted therapy. Understanding professional attitudes can inform training, education, and policy discussions, particularly as research and clinical trials for psychedelic-assisted therapy expand in the UK.</p>

    <section id="procedure">
        <h2>What will I have to do if I take part?</h2>
        <p>If you are interested in taking part, you will be invited to give consent. Giving consent will involve a mandatory tick-box on the next page in this online survey. No signed consent form is required because participation is anonymous.</p>
        <p>If you decide to participate, you can proceed with completing this online survey. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. At the start, you will be asked to create a keyword that does not contain any personal information or identifiable information. This keyword can be emailed to the researcher within two weeks of completing the survey if you wish to withdraw your data.</p>
        <p>You will receive a brief, neutral description of psychedelic-assisted therapy and be randomly assigned to one of two conditions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A vignette describing psychedelic-assisted therapy</li>
            <li>A vignette describing supportive group therapy</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You will then be asked to complete the adapted Attitudes Toward Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy questionnaire. At the end of the survey, you will be asked to complete a brief demographic questionnaire.</p>

    <section id="risks">
        <h2>What are the possible risks with taking part?</h2>
        <p>Participation in this study is considered low risk. The possible risks involved with this study are that you may experience mild discomfort when reflecting on your attitudes toward psychedelic-assisted therapy. Any discomfort is expected to be minimal and temporary.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
        <h2>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h2>
        <p>We can't promise the study will help you personally. However, the results should help our understanding of professional attitudes toward psychedelic-assisted therapy. This, in turn, is expected to be beneficial to mental health training, policy discussions, and the safe implementation of emerging therapies in Scotland.</p>
